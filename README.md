# Merge-Sort-for-Linked-List

## Difficulty: Medium

Given a pointer/reference to the head of the linked list, the task is to sort the given linked list using Merge Sort.
Note: If the length of the linked list is odd, then the extra node should go into the first list while splitting.

Examples:

Input: LinkedList: 3->5->2->4->1
Output: 1->2->3->4->5
Explanation: After sorting the given linked list, the resultant matrix will be 1->2->3->4->5.

Input: LinkedList: 9->15->0
Output: 0->9->15
Explanation: After sorting the given linked list , resultant will be 0->9->15.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n*log(n))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)
